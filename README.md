Python: House Sales Price Prediction – Linear Regression Analysis 
•Built Predictive Modeling via Linear Regression to identify the house sales price in Iowa. 
•Performed EDA and utilized the descriptive stats charts to find the correlation between the variables w/ Machine Learning packages Pandas and Visualization packages Matplotlib/Seaborn in Python. 
•Cleansed the raw data set w/ 3,000 observations and 80 dimensions by removing missing values/ outliers, one-hot encoding on categorical variables and normalizing the numeric variables. 
•Fit the predictors into the linear regression model using Statsmodel to identify the sales price of each house.
